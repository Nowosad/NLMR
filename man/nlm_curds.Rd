\usage{
nlm_curds(curds, recursion_steps, wheyes = NULL, resolution = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{curds}{[\code{numerical(x)}]\cr
Vector with percentage(s) to fill with curds (fill with Habitat (value ==
TRUE)).}

\item{recursion_steps}{[\code{numerical(x)}]\cr
Vector of successive cutting steps for the blocks (split 1 block into x
blocks).}

\item{wheyes}{[\code{numerical(x)}]\cr
Vector with percentage(s) to fill with wheyes, which fill matrix in an
additional step with habitat.#'}

\item{resolution}{[\code{numerical(1)}]\cr
Resolution of the resulting raster.}

\description{
Simulates a curdled neutral landscape model with optional wheys.
}
\details{
Random curdling recursively subdivides the plane into blocks.
At each level of the recursion, a fraction of the this block is declared as
habitat (value == TRUE) while the remaining stays matrix (value == FALSE).

With the optional argument for wheys, previously selected cells that were
declared matrix (value == FALSE) during recursion, can now contain a
proportion (\code{q}) of habitat cells.

If \deqn{curds_{1} = curds_{2} = recursion_steps_{2} = ... = curds_{n} =
recursion_steps_{n}} the models resembles a binary random map.

Note that you can not set ncol and nrow with this landscape algorithm.
The amount of cells and hence dimension of the raster is given by the vectorproduct of s.

# simulate random curdling
(random_curdling <- nlm_curds(curds = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.6),
                              recursion_steps = c(32, 6, 2)))

# simulate wheyed curdling
(wheyed_curdling <- nlm_curds(curds = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.6),
                              recursion_steps = c(32, 6, 2),
                              wheyes = c(0.1, 0.05, 0.2)))
