  The present study presents a method for generating random maps

  of these scaled landscapes are analyzed and compared to patterns
  on totally random, unstructured landscapes. Hierar-chical
  structure permits percolation (i.e., continous habitat spanning
  the landscape) under a greater variety of conditions than found
  on totally random landscapes. Habitat clusters on structured
  maps tend to have smaller perimeters. The clusters tend to be
  less clumped on sparsely occupied landscapes and more clumped in
  densely occupied conditions. Hierarchical structure changes the
  expected spatial properties of the landscape, indicating a
  strong need for this new generation of neutral models.",

  abstract  = "The dynamics of populations inhabiting range margins are likely
  to be critically important in determining the response of
  species to climate change. Despite this, there is a lack of both
  empirical and theoretical work that examines the behaviour of
  these populations. Populations living on the edge of a species'
  range frequently inhabit a more patchily distributed habitat
  than those that live closer to the centre of the range. This
  difference is likely to play an important role in determining
  the dynamics of range margin populations, both when the range is
  static and when it is dynamic, for example shifting in response
  to climate change. Here, we present a simple method that
  simulates the distribution of suitable habitat sites at the edge
  of a range. Habitat availability is determined as a function of
  both latitudinal and local environmental variability, and the
  relative importance of the two can be adjusted. The method is
  readily extended to describe shifting habitat availability
  during a period of climate change. We suggest that there is a
  need for a greater effort to examine the ecology of range margin
  populations, and believe that the method presented here could be
  of considerable use in future theoretical studies.",

  abstract = "Climate change and land use management practices are major
  drivers of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. To understand
  and predict resulting changes in community structures,
  individual-based and spatially explicit population models are a
  useful tool but require detailed data sets for each species. More
  generic approaches are thus needed. Here we present a trait-based
  functional type approach to model savanna birds. The aim of our
  model is to explore the response of different bird functional
  types to modifications in habitat structure. The functional types
  are characterized by different traits, in particular body mass,
  which is related to life-history traits (reproduction and
  mortality) and spatial scales (home range area and dispersal
  ability), as well as the use of vegetation structures for
  foraging and nesting, which is related to habitat quality and
  suitability. We tested the performance of the functional types in
  artificial landscapes varying in shrub:grass ratio and clumping
  intensity of shrub patches. We found that an increase in shrub
  encroachment and a decrease in habitat quality caused by land use
  mismanagement and climate change endangered all simulated bird
  functional types. The strength of this effect was related to the
  preferred habitat. Furthermore, larger-bodied insectivores and
  omnivores were more prone to extinction due to shrub encroachment
  compared to small-bodied species. Insectivorous and omnivorous
  birds were more sensitive to clumping intensity of shrubs whereas
  herbivorous and carnivorous birds were most affected by a
  decreasing amount of grass cover. From an applied point of view,
  our findings emphasize that policies such as woody plant removal
  and a reduction in livestock stocking rates to prevent shrub
  encroachment should prioritize the enlargement of existing
  grassland patches. Overall, our results show that the combination
  of an individual-based modelling approach with carefully defined
  functional types can provide a powerful tool for exploring
  biodiversity responses to environmental changes. Furthermore, the
  increasing accumulation of worldwide data sets on species' core
  and soft traits (surrogates to determine core traits indirectly)
  on one side and the refinement of conceptual frameworks for
  animal functional types on the other side will further improve
  functional type approaches which consider the sensitivities of
  multiple species to climate change, habitat loss, and
  fragmentation.",

  along the dominant environmental gradient were randomly placed on
  these landscapes and were allowed to reproduce, disperse, and
  compete. The results demonstrate that the effect of a landscape's
  environmental variability on species coexistence is affected by
  the degree of spatial dependence in a complex manner. Increasing
  the fractal dimension (decreasing spatial dependence) allows more
  species to exist per microsite and per landscape. However,
  extremely high fractal dimensions cause fewer species to coexist
  on the landscape scale. Observed habitat breadths are increased
  (and beta diversity is decreased) as a function of D. I suggest
  that these patterns can be explained by habitat area, the mass
  effect, ecological equivalency, and global biological

  abstract = "Dynamical mosaic models are very useful in ecology to study the
  influence of patterns on some ecological processes. Examples of
  such mosaics are patches of agricultural or forested landscapes.
  They are often built on the basis of either explicit processes or
  on neutral approaches using random or almost random element
  generation. Yet, most of the latter, called neutral landscape
  models, use a grid-based scheme and simulate pixel mosaics that
  are autonomous and/or independent. This scheme is not perfectly
  adapted to anthropogenic patchy landscapes made of contiguous and
  uniform polygons. Landscape ecology for example explains how a
  landscape may be seen as a complex mosaic of patches and
  corridors, with dynamical compositions (the patch attributes) and
  configurations (their shapes and neighbourhoods). This work
  presents three neutral landscape models dedicated to
  manipulations of polygonal patchy mosaic configurations as
  compared to an observed one. These models have respective
  advantages that can be summarised in an increasing ability to
  simulate realistic anthropogenic landscape mosaics. The
  tessellation approach is simple and rapid, but very much
  constrained by the patch shapes and positions. The Gibbs
  algorithm method adapted to landscapes is powerful to manipulate
  patch positions, with still a weak control on patch shapes. The
  last method based on a Delaunay triangulation technique offers
  the opportunity to modulate patch shapes and can still be
  combined with the Gibbs method to optimise the patch positions.
  With such neutral landscape models, it is possible to explore
  ecological hypotheses using a wide range of controlled patchy
  mosaics. \copyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

  systematically and independently varied. Furthermore, a degree of
  control over the irregularity of the shapes of the simulated
  landscapes can be achieved, and it is also possible to simulate

  practical possibilities of this method in different areas of
